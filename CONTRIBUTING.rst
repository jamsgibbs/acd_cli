Contributing guidelines
=======================

Using the Issue tracker
-----------------------

The issue tracker is not a forum! This does not mean there is no need for good etiquette, but
that you should not post unnecessary information. Each reply will cause a notification to be
sent to all of the issue's participants and some of them might consider it spam.

For minor corrections or additions, try to update your posts rather than writing a new reply.
Use strike-through markdown for corrections and put updates at the bottom of your original post.

+1ing an issue or "me, too" replies will not get anything done faster.

Adding Issues
+++++++++++++

Before adding an issue, check that you are using the latest master commit and there is no
existing issue that fits your problem. Try to reproduce the issue on another machine or ideally on
another operating system, if possible.

Please provide as much possibly relevant information as you can.
You might find the ``--verbose`` and, to a lesser extent, ``--debug`` options helpful.

Use `code block markup <https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/>`_ for console
output, log messages, etc.

Questions may also be directed at `acd_cli@mail.com <mailto:acd_cli@mail.com>`_ or
asked in the `chat <https://gitter.im/cloud-drive/acd_cli>`_.

Code
----

There are no real programming guidelines as of yet. Please use type hints like specified in PEP 0484
where appropriate and limit line length to 100 characters.

It is a generally a good idea to announce that you are working on an issue by explicitly stating
this on the issue tracker.

Please squash your commits before making a pull request.

Have a look at `Github's general guide how to contribute
<https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/#contributing>`_.

There is also a `TODO <docs/TODO.rst>`_ list of some of the open tasks.

Donations
---------

You might also want to consider `making a donation
<https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=V4V4HVSAH4VW8>`_
to further the development of acd\_cli.
